# 1084SAdapter
Universal 1084S Monitor Adapter ‚Äì DIN ‚Üî DE9 RGB Adapter/Monitor for Amiga, Tandy, and analog/digital RGB 1980's computers

**Philips DIN ‚Üî Daewoo DE9 Converter and signal debugger/monitor**

This board adapts between different 1084S monitor standards‚Äîcommonly found in Philips and Daewoo variants‚Äîand allows flexible signal routing for Amiga, CGA-based PCs, and other retro systems.

## üåü Key Features & Use Cases

This board supports multiple configurations on a 1084S monitor (Magnavox, Philips, etc) from the 1980s and early 1990s:

1. **Philips (DIN-based) to Amiga (DE9)**  
   Use this to connect a DIN-based 1084 monitor (typically Philips) to an Amiga that outputs via DE9.

2. **Daewoo (DE9-based) to Amiga (DIN)**  
   Use this to connect a DE9-based 1084 monitor (typically Daewoo) to an Amiga that outputs via DIN.

3. **Cross-compatibility**  
   Adapt any other computer using these connectors, including hybrid setups.

4. **CGA (Tandy 1000) to Philips 1084S (DIN)**  
   Use this board to connect CGA-based PCs to a digital DIN-based monitor like the Philips 1084.

5. **Real-time signal troubleshooting**  
   Connect two boards back-to-back to test sync and RGB lines without format conversion:  
   ```
   Monitor (Analog RGB input) 
     <-> DIN6 male-male cable 
     <-> Adapter Board 
     <-> DE9 male-male cable 
     <-> Adapter Board 
     <-> DIN6 male (Amiga cable/Amiga)
   ```

6. **Signal analysis and custom monitor adapter testing**  
   Use an oscilloscope with this board while designing new adapters or troubleshooting pinouts by experimenting with sync jumper configurations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This board gives you *a lot* of flexibility‚Äîbut with that comes responsibility.  
Incorrect jumper settings, especially for sync signals, can **damage your monitor**. Be **absolutely certain** you understand what you're doing when adjusting jumper settings (J4‚ÄìJ9). You assume all risk for damage caused by improper usage.

---

## üîß Default Configuration

Out of the box, the board routes Horizontal and Vertical Sync directly:

- **J4 (HSYNC)**: Enabled ‚Üí Position **1‚Äì2**  
- **J7 (VSYNC)**: Enabled ‚Üí Position **1‚Äì2**

---

## üß© Jumper Reference (Sync Routing)

Use these jumpers to customize how sync signals are routed:

| Jumper | Routes From (J1/J2) | To (J3 - DE9)      | Notes               |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **J4** | HSYNC               | HSYNC              | **Default ON** (1‚Äì2) |
| **J5** | HSYNC               | VSYNC              | Optional             |
| **J6** | HSYNC               | CSYNC              | Optional             |
| **J7** | VSYNC               | VSYNC              | **Default ON** (1‚Äì2) |
| **J8** | VSYNC               | HSYNC              | Optional             |
| **J9** | VSYNC               | CSYNC              | Optional             |

**Note:** Only enable the jumpers that suit your configuration. Never enable conflicting signals unless you're absolutely sure.

### Example (Hypothetical Scenario):
You have a monitor that **only accepts CSYNC**, but your system provides separate HSYNC and VSYNC via DIN.  
You might try:
- Enable **J9**: VSYNC ‚Üí CSYNC  
- Optionally enable **J6**: HSYNC ‚Üí CSYNC  
‚ö†Ô∏è This is theoretical; test carefully and monitor your signals.

## üìå Connector Pinouts

These are the relevant pinouts for the **Commodore 1084S** monitor. Understanding these is critical for properly wiring and configuring sync routing via jumpers (J4‚ÄìJ9).

### üñ•Ô∏è J3 ‚Äì DE9 Video Connector (Female, at Monitor)

This connector supports **both analog and digital RGB**, combining signals from the DIN connectors internally.

| Pin | Name   | Analog Mode         | Digital Mode        |
|-----|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 1   | GND    | Ground              | Ground               |
| 2   | GND    | Ground              | Ground               |
| 3   | R      | Red                 | Red                  |
| 4   | G      | Green               | Green                |
| 5   | B      | Blue                | Blue                 |
| 6   | I      | *Not Connected*     | Intensity            |
| 7   | CSYNC  | Composite Sync      | *Not Connected*      |
| 8   | HSYNC  | *Not Connected*     | Horizontal Sync      |
| 9   | VSYNC  | *Not Connected*     | Vertical Sync        |

üìù **Note:** The 1084S DE9 connector internally combines analog and digital signals from the two DIN connectors. That‚Äôs why this board can act as a bidirectional adapter between Philips-style and Daewoo-style 1084S monitors.
